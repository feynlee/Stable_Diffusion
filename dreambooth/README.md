# DreamBooth for Stable_Diffusion

This notebook is adapted from [ShivamShrirao's notebook](https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth).
I've added a section `Saving to HuggingFace Hub` to save the trained model to HuggingFace Hub, so it's available through `StableDiffusionPipeline` directly.

Here's a good [video tutorial by JAMES CUNLIFFE](https://youtu.be/FaLTztGGueQ) using ShivamShrirao's original notebook.
